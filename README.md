# DCI

This repo contains examples of implementing the DCI (Data, Context,
Interaction) pattern in the Golang and Javascript.

At the time I wrote these, I was using DCI as an impetutus to learn more about
JS and Go. Thus you'll see different versions for each implementation, as I
learned more about the language and as my understanding of DCI increased I
refined my approach. Refining these examples has taken a couple of months even
though they are all included in the same commit.

## Golang
To run the golang examples clone the repo and run './setgopath.sh' and then go
to the godci directory select the version and run for example in the v4
directory 'go run dcitutv4.go'

v4 is the latest and most correct version.

## Javascript
These examples require node version 0.10.30+. To run go to jsdci and run 'node
jsdciv5'.

v5 is the latest and most correct version.  v6 is an interesting but failed
experiement.
